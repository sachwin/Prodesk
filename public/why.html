            Why Stand and Work
          </h1>
          <h2 class="block-title">TIME TO TAKE A STAND</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
          Too much of anything kills. The same is true of fried food, alcohol, and now – researchers have found out – ‘Sitting’. Sitting
          too much can kill you. Sounds dramatic, but it’s true.
        </p>
        <p>
          A study reveals that men who sit 6 hours or more a day have an overall death rate that’s 20% higher than men who sit for
          3 hours or less. For women, it’s 40%. And consider this: nothing you do can cancel out the effects of sitting for
          long hours in the office. Sitting harms you even if you benefit from a gym workout. Whenever possible, office workers
          are advised to get up and take movement breaks throughout the day. It’s not always easy to just walk away from
          the task at hand, though, so in some cases workers are combining the best of both worlds by installing standing
          desks.

          Benefits of a Standing Desk
        </h1>
        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          Boost Productivity at Work
        </h2>
        <p>
          A new study suggests that standing desks could boost productivity at workplace by a whopping 46%. Standing helps get things
          done as it forces you to focus more deeply and plough through work. It reduces fatigue and maintains mental sharpness,
          something that is not typical of sitting for hours at a workstation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Research published in IIE Transactions on Occupational Ergonomics and Human Factors suggest that, working at standing desk
          benefits productivity. The findings revealed that workers with desks that allow for standing were about 45% more
          productive on a daily basis than those who remained seated.
        </p>
        <p>Further, productivity of the stand-capable desk users significantly increased over time, from about 23% in the 1st
          month to 53% over the next 6 months. As an added bonus, standing desks are so customizable and even when you're
          sitting you can set it at a better height than where your desk usually is, leading to generally more straight-backed
          working.
        </p>
        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          Help Improve Mood & Energy Levels
        </h2>
        <p>Standing desks appear to have a positive influence on overall well-being. In a recent study, participants using standing
          desks reported less stress and fatigue than those who remained seated the entire work day.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, 87% of those using standing desks reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day. Upon returning
          to their old desks, overall moods reverted to their original levels. These findings align with broader research
          on sitting and mental health, which links sedentary time with an increased risk of both depression and anxiety.
          By standing during the day, we're able to keep energy levels constant. As a result, your mind doesn't drift, your
          eyes don't droop, and you can get through your day without experiencing an energy roller coaster.
        </p>
        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          More Calories Burned
        </h2>
        <p>How many calories can you burn by switching from a sit-down desk to a stand-up desk? More than you think. An adjustable
          height desk can help you avoid the health pitfalls of sitting all day, and you can burn calories at the same time.
          Here’s how sitting affects your health: when you slump in your chair, your calorie-burning slows to a third of
          the rate compared to walking. Metabolism drops. As a result, your risk of becoming obese and developing diabetes
          grows.
        </p>
        <p>Here, by using a standing desk at work, you burn more calories and counteract the effects of sitting for long periods
          of time. In fact, when compared to an afternoon of sedentary work, an equal amount of time spent standing has been
          shown to burn over 170 additional calories. That’s almost 1000 extra calories burned each week from simply standing
          at your desk each afternoon. Standing desks are suitable for home office workers, computer desk users, students,
          cubicle dwellers and office executives. So check out a standing desk and take control of your health and productivity.
        </p>

        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          Better Overall Health
        </h2>
        <p>The twenty-first century lifestyle is more sedentary than ever before. Overweight, obesity and diabetes are also
          more prevalent. A healthy diet and regular exercise are still the best ways to lose weight and prevent diabetes,
          but a standing desk can help, especially if you are not used to exercise. A stand-up desk encourages you to stay
          active throughout the day, and movement is a good way to stay fit and healthy during desk work.</p>
        <p>Of course, standing all day can be tiring; you may not be able to handle more than fifteen minutes at a time. Fortunately,
          most standing desks are adjustable desks that enable you to move from standing to sitting and back again. Sit-to-stand
          desks allow you to vary your position and change it with ease.
        </p>
        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          Help You Live Longer
        </h2>
        <p>The Standing Desk has been designed to aid its user into living a healthier and physiologically sound way of living.
          Studies have found a strong link between increased sitting time and early death. In fact, a review of 18 studies
          found those who sit the most are at a 49% greater risk of dying early than those who sit the least.
        </p>
        <p>Another study estimated that reducing sitting time to 3 hours per day would raise the average person’s life expectancy
          by 2 years. The transition from sitting to standing at work, although would initially be quite a daunting notion,
          will see you live a longer, happier and generally more fulfilling life.

          Important Standing Desk considerations
        </h1>
        <p>
          Are you inspired to take your office space to a higher level? Once you have taken the First step
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="block-title">Start slow - </span>Don’t try to go from usual hours of sitting to zero overnight. Aim
          to sit just 3 of your working hours each day. So start with just 20 minutes at a time at your standing desk, then
          add on time as you get used to the setup. Standing doesn’t sound like a lot of work, but when your body is used
          to sitting most of the day, you will strain your body by standing too much, too fast.
        </p>
        <p><span class="block-title">Use a mat - </span>Take it easy on your knees, hips, and ankles by using a gel mat where
          you plan to stand. Take it a step further and wear non-slip, supportive shoes, too.</p>
        <p><span class="block-title">Get your work done - </span>If standing is too distracting; use your sitting times when
          you need that extra concentration. You may find the standing desk a little distracting at first, but you’ll likely
          adjust and learn to refocus with time.</p>
        <p><span class="block-title">Set it up right - </span>Your computer screen should sit 15 to 30 inches from your eyes,
          with your eye level even with (or slightly below) your screen. Keep your wrists flat and your elbows at a 90-degree
          angle. If you feel like any part of your body is straining while you are standing then you need to make adjustments
          to make it more comfortable.</p>
        <p><span class="block-title">Move, too - </span>Standing does burn more calories than sitting, but to really see optimal
          health benefits make sure you are walking throughout the workday, too. Buy a pedometer or a fitness tracker and
          add in steps where you see fit during the day. Look for creative ways to do other exercises during the workday,
          too, that stretch your muscles and keep your circulation and metabolism going.</p>

        <p><span class="block-title">Thinking about installing a standing desk for your own office space? </span>Without a doubt,
          standing tables have become the mark of a hip office. Any self-respecting startup that claims to hold employees'
          well-being at the top of its priorities is hopping on this bandwagon. People across the country and even around
          the world are taking a stand at work. The large companies are jumping in too — including AOL, Google, Twitter and
          Facebook.</p>
        <p>So, what are you waiting for? Stand up for yourself and experience the benefits…!</p>
